# Getting started with docker-proxy

### What is this and why?

This is a simple proxy to remotely connect to Docker deamon. We use it for log streaming. This is a component of a larger system, it does not do anything useful by itself.

> Note: This is dangerous, **do not use on public networks**



### How to use

Clone repository 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kloudtaxi/docker-proxy.git
```

Rn docker compose file
```sh
docker compose run -d
```
